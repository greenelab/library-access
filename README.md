# Data on Library Access to Scholarly Literature

This repository is cataloging University Library access to scholarly literature.
Scholarly articles are identified using their DOIs.
The impetus for this project was [this discussion](https://github.com/greenelab/scihub-manuscript/issues/21 "Potential followup: comparison to authorized access") on the Sci-Hub Coverage Study.
